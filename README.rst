Support for partial content in Django staticfiles.

After an installation add the following app to your settings.
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django-partial-content',
    ...
]
```

After that Django will respect `Range` header in requests to static files. Note that using `staticfiles` module in production is not recommended. The extension is only for ease of development.

Tested with Django 3.0, SRWare Iron and files no larger than 40MB.

Known issues:
 - Multiple ranges aren't supported.
 - Big files aren't supported yet.
